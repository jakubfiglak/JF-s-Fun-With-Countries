# Jakub Figlak's Fun With Countries

This is the second project I made during Coder's Camp 2019 edition. This is the simple app, where you can search for some info about the countries and then test your knowledge with some quiz.

## Feature 1 - search for a country

You can search for a country by just putting some text into the input field. Countries, which names match the criteria, will be displayed in the section below.

If there's more than one country displayed, you can navigate through the slider by clicking pink arrows.

## Feature 2 - test your knowledge

In this section, you can generate, by clicking 'Generate test' button a test containing 10 questions about countries capital cities.

When you're done, you can click the button 'Check your answers' and you'll find out your test result.
